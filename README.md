# Tasks-Management-System-with-a-Menu
This task management system gives user the ability to create tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks, and view tasks.

## WHAT THE PROJECT DOES
This project gives users the ability to create, edit, delete, and view tasks. The program will display the menu to the user with options. The user has the option to choose between 5 different choices. Those five choices include creating, editing, deleting, and viewing tasks. The last choice gives the user to exit the program. The program makes use of a switch-case statement and lots of input validation to ensure that proper input is received by the program.

## WHAT TECH WAS USED
This program was created using VSCommunity in the C++ language. The program uses the vector and string libraries, since tasks are to be stored in a string vector.

## WHAT I LEARNED
This project helped me gain a better understanding of how to organize different functions of the program using functions. It also helped me gain a better understanding of how input validations work. I got a better idea of how to dynamically allocate a vector. All in all, this was a fun project to work on.
